I am building a stucture. So we started hoarding carboard boxes in our apartment.

I sketched what I wanted the "portal" to look like, and then quickly realized that it is not going to be very pretty. I'm also worried that cardboard may not have been the best choice. I think I might wrap the structure itself in a sheet to give it somekind of elegance. Is that even elegance? I wouldn't generally call Ikea king-sized sheets elegant, but I guess they're still more elegant than cardboard, right? What I'm hoping is that the darkness within the structure will be lit by the blinking of the gif I've created. 

The way I see it, the "traveler" will take a tablet into the "portal" as the gif begins. At the end of the gif, they will be instructed to exit the portal and encounter a sign that tells them the exact time that they have "arrived". What I am trying to create is more of an experience than enything else. Right now, it feels more like the experience of being a really bored homeless person, but by tuesday I am hoping that it might resemble something entirely different!
