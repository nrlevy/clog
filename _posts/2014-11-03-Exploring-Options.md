I’m not exactly sure what this blog post is supposed to be about, but I’ve been thinking a lot lately about visualization. Visualizing information is becoming more and more of a pain for me. It’s bad enough when my hands won’t make the images I see in my head, but what is more frustrating is when I can’t even make the right pictures in my mind. 

This feels like a different problem than I’ve faced before. Generally speaking, my issues with visual representation have been technical. What I’m dealing with now seems more theoretical. Even when I eventually manage to actually produce something, who is to say that the meaning won’t get lost in translation?

This idea led me to think about what exactly I find most frustrating when it comes to info graphics.  When it comes to maps, my biggest issue stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what is being represented. Often, this stems from a poor legend, or possibly no legend at all. When it comes to other types of info graphics, a similar issue is a lack of context. Often, I find that the numbers, locations, or subjects are splashed on to a lovely illustration without any kind of direction or scale.
