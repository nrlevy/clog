I’m not exactly sure what this blog post is supposed to be about, but I’ve been thinking a lot lately about visualization. Visualizing information is becoming more and more of a pain for me. It’s bad enough when my hands won’t make the images I see in my head, but what is more frustrating is when I can’t even make the right pictures in my mind. 

This feels like a different problem than I’ve faced before. Generally speaking, my issues with visual representation have been technical. What I’m dealing with now seems more theoretical. Even when I eventually manage to actually produce something, who is to say that the meaning won’t get lost in translation?

This idea led me to think about what exactly I find most frustrating when it comes to info graphics.  When it comes to maps, my biggest issue stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what is being represented. Often, this stems from a poor legend, or possibly no legend at all. When it comes to other types of info graphics, a similar issue is a lack of context. Often, I find that the numbers, locations, or subjects are splashed on to a lovely illustration without any kind of direction or scale. My immediate assumption when I see that is I am being misled. I think there is an inherent link between a dearth of information and a lack of trust. 

At the end of the day, I think it's most important to maintain a level of trust or credibility. Am I mapping something that is verifiable? Am I mapping something more theoretical? What *am* I doing?

PROJECT IDEAS:

1) Something to do with time-travel. 
	I love time-travel as a concept and my favorite movie is "Back to the Future", is there something there? I like the idea of a timeline with infinite tangents based on 'what could have been'.
	[How Time Travel Works](http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/time-travel.htm)

2) The life of a product.
	Perhaps a map of how a product is made and used? But hopefully, a very unique product with an interesting life-cycle. Something that incorporates both location and motion.

3) The map of James Bond
	where has 007 been? where has he thwarted enemies? where has he made love? how to they all intertwine. 
	[The World of 007](http://www.007.com/)


Do all of my ideas blow?
