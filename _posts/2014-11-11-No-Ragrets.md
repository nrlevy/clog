The other day I was hanging out with a classmate and an idea struck me. How could I have not thought of it before? This class asks us to make a map for Pete's sake! (on a side note, I've always found that to be a really weird phrase, "for Pete's sake," do I not get it because Iâ€™m Jewish?) The idea that I should've proposed last Tuesday was a map of all of the locations at which I've been cat-called since moving to DC/Baltimore. 

I have never, in my life, been cat-called more than in the city of Baltimore, and I don't even live here full time. I'm starting to wonder if it has something to do with the culture of the city itself. I have noticed that strangers are much more friendly here than in other large cities, but does that also translate into over-stepping boundaries? Invasions of personal space? 

The worst thing about these invasions is that any reaction at all seems to just encourage these strangers. It doesn't matter how revolted I look, it seems to egg them on. Once I had the courage to snap right back with "Don't do that, women don't like that." All I got in return was laughs and more snide remarks about how he "knows was girls like."  It's so damn frustrating. 

So in the end, I think I might end up with 2 separate maps that describe 2 very different things. One that is more theoretical, a map of time-travel, and one that is much more tangible, a map of cat-calling. I just hope I can get it all done in time (ha, sorry, couldn't help it).
